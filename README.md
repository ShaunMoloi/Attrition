The repo will showcase Python code to determine which factors keep employees at the company and which prompt others to leave.

This case study explores how a data scientist can analyze and address the problem of high
employee attrition within ExploreEdge from their 13,450 employees.

Exploratory Data Analysis will be conducted to identify the key factors contributing to attrition, build a predictive model to
forecast attrition risk, and propose data-driven strategies to reduce employee turnover.

The analysis will involve exploring various HR and employee-related data to gain insights that
can be used to make informed decisions and improve employee retention.
The primary objective of this case study is to provide a recommendation that will assist ExploreEdge in predicting employee attrition and addressing/derisking by providing data-driven insights and recommendations based on the analysis of historical employee data.
